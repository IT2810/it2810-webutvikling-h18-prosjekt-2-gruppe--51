"text": "Outside the sky is light with stars;\nThere's a hollow roaring from the sea.\nAnd, alas! for the little almond flowers,\nThe wind is shaking the almond tree.\n\nHow little I thought, a year ago,\nIn the horrible cottage upon the Lee\nThat he and I should be sitting so\nAnd sipping a cup of camomile tea.\n\nLight as feathers the witches fly,\nThe horn of the moon is plain to see;\nBy a firefly under a jonquil flower\nA goblin toasts a bumble-bee."}
