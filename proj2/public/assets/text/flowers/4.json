    "text": "The spring wind comes from the east and quickly passes,\nLeaving faint ripples in the wine of the golden bowl.\nThe flowers fall, flake after flake, myriads together.\n\nYou, pretty girl, wine-flushed,\nYour rosy face is rosier still.\nHow long may the peach and plum trees flower\nBy the green-painted house?\nThe fleeting light deceives man,\nBrings soon the stumbling age.\n\nRise and dance\nIn the westering sun\nWhile the urge of youthful years is yet unsubdued!\nWhat avails to lament after one's hair has turned white\nlike silken threads?"}
