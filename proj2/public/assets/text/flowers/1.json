{"author": "John Milton","title": "Lycidas", "text": "YET once more, O ye laurels, and once more,\nYe myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,\nI come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,\nAnd with forced fingers rude\nShatter your leaves before the mellowing year.\nBitter constraint and sad occasion dear\nCompels me to disturb your season due;\nFor Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,\nYoung Lycidas, and hath not left his peer.\nWho would not sing for Lycidas? he knew\nHimself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.\nHe must not float upon his watery bier\nUnwept, and welter to the parching wind,\nWithout the meed of some melodious tear."}
