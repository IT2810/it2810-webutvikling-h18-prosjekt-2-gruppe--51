    "text": "Open the window, and let the air \nFreshly blow upon face and hair, \nAnd fill the room, as it fills the night, \nWith the breath of the rain's sweet might. \nHark! the burthen, swift and prone! \nAnd how the odorous limes are blown! \nStormy Love's abroad, and keeps \nHopeful coil for gentle sleeps. \n\nNot a blink shall burn to-night \nIn my chamber, of sordid light; \nNought will I have, not a window-pane, \n'Twixt me and the air and the great good rain, \nWhich ever shall sing me sharp lullabies"}
