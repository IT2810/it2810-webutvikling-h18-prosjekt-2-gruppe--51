    "text": "The silken threads by viewless spinners spun, \nWhich float so idly on the summer air, \nAnd help to make each summer morning fair, \nShining like silver in the summer sun, \nAre caught by wayward breezes, one by one, \nAre blown to east and west and fastened there, \nWeaving on all the roads their sudden snare. \nNo sign which road doth safest, freest run, \nThe wing'd insects know, that soar so gay \nTo meet their death upon each summer day. \nHow dare we any human deed arraign; \nAttempt to recon any moment's cost; \nOr any pathway trust as safe and plain \nBecause we see not where the threads have crossed?"}
