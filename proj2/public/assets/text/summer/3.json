    "text": "A white face, drooping, on a bending neck:\nA tube-rose that with heavy petal curves\nHer stem: a foam-bell on a wave that swerves\nBack from the undulating vessel's deck.\n\nFrom out the whitest cloud of summer steals\nThe wildest lightning: from this face of thine\nThy soul, a fire-of-heaven, warm and fine,\nIn marvellous flashes its fair self reveals.\n\nAs when one gazes from the summer sea\nOn some far gossamer cloud, with straining eye,\nFearing to see it vanish in the sky,\nSo, floating, wandering Cloud-Soul, I watch thee."}
